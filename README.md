# Okadora
[![build-okadora](https://github.com/okanilibe/okadora/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/okanilibe/okadora/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Custom Fedora Atomic Image for Desktops and Laptops. This is my take on what the modern Linux Desktop should look like.

# Purpose

This is an image that is built on the work of [Universal Blue](https://github.com/ublue-os), [Bazzite](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite), and [Fedora Silverblue](https://fedoraproject.org/silverblue/) projects.

The `Containerfile` is built directly off of [Bazzite](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite).

**This image is not recommended for general usage.**

If you want images designed for general consumption, I suggest using [Bazzite](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite) or [Bluefin](https://github.com/ublue-os/bluefin) from the Universal Blue project.

## Using the Image

If you do decide you want to try my image, you will want to rebase from Fedora Silverblue using this command:

```bash
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/okanilibe/okadora:latest
```

After rebase, you will need to run the command below to install all flatpaks that are shipped with Bazzite and Okadora

```bash
ujust _install-okadora-flatpaks
```

If there is demand, I may publish ISOs.

## Verification

These images are signed with sigstore's [cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/). You can verify the signature by downloading the `cosign.pub` key from this repo and running the following command:

```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/okanilibe/okadora
```

## Special Thanks

The contributors at Universal Blue, Bazzite, and Fedora are amazing. This image would not exist without the incredible work they do every day!
